I'm a final year computer science student at The University of Manchester with an interest in software engineering and FinTech, and have a major interest in high performance computing, distributed systems, and low latency programming. I have experience in software development in financial and software firms, and am constantly looking to learn more through hands-on projects. My pinned projects including a trading system created using C++, capable of listing buy and sell orders for any equity of your choice. This project is being developed consistently so if you have any pull requests or suggestions please don't hesitate to make them! I am currently focusing on development of the trading system, as well as the compiler for my own language "Micro" that can both be accessed through my GitHub.

Some projects are private to prevent redistribution, and to make it easier to navigate my best projects. Please contact me if you'd like access to further machine learning and natural language processing projects on my resume.
